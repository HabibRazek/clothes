NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_secret_key
NEXTAUTH_URL=your_vercel_domain
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
ADMIN_EMAIL=your_admin_email
```

### 2. Database Setup
```bash
# Generate Prisma client
npx prisma generate

# Push schema to database
npx prisma db push

# Seed initial data (optional)
npm run db:seed
```

### 3. Build Verification
```bash
# Local build test
npm run build

# Expected output:
# âœ“ Creating an optimized production build
# âš  Compiled with warnings (non-blocking)
# âœ“ Checking validity of types
# âœ“ Collecting page data
# âœ“ Generating static pages
# âœ“ Build completed successfully
```

### 4. Vercel Deployment
